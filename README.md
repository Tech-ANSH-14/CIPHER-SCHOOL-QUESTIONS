# <b>DAY<b> -6

Ques 1: Write a C++ program that declares an integer variable, initializes it, and then declares a pointer that stores the address of this variable. Print the value of the variable using both the variable itself and the pointer.

Ques 2: Write a program that declares an array of integers and a pointer that points to the first element of the array. Use pointer arithmetic to print all the elements of the array.

# DAY - 7

Ques 1: Write a function int findMax(const int arr[], int size) that finds and returns the maximum value in an integer array. Test your function with various arrays in the main() function.
Example:
Input: {1, 5, 3, 9, 2}
Output: 9

Ques 2: Write a function bool isPalindrome(const std::string &str) that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward). The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity. Test your function with various strings in the main() function.
Example:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: true
